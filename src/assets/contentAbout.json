      "text": "#hack19 Prague was a Flutter hackathon organized by [Inventi <Labs/>](http://ilabs.cz/)\n[Vitaliy Misurenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitaliymisurenko) and I had a few hours to pitch some flutter-community related idea, build an app and present it. To that point, both Vitaliy and I have never worked with Flutter before so learning on the go with the time running out was a really interesting experience. [The website](https://www.hack19prague.com/) of this event is down, but the event itself can be found [here](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Dart-Flutter-in-Prague/events/261347593/) and some press coverage [here](https://tyinternety.cz/kalendar-akci/hack19-international-flutter-hackathon-prague/) or [here](https://dotekomanie.cz/2019/05/hack19-international-hackathon-prague/)."
